# Suppression of Adaptive Responses to Cancer Therapy by Transcriptional Repression

## Notes

1. We have a lot of targeted kinases however resistance to them soon emerges.

2. The paper proposes that cancer cells adapt to targeted kinases therapy but if the same therapy is given in combination with THZ1 which is a CDK7/12 inhibitor then it prevents this adaptation from happening.

3. The paper then tries to look into what is THZ1 doing differently that it is preventing this adaptation from happening. They are proposing that CDK7/12 which are inhibited by THZ1 prevents enhancer formation at certain genes. These are genes which work on causing resistance emergence to targeted therapy. It also impedes the engagement of transcriptional programmes required for tumor cell survival.

4. The authors have done an RNA-Seq and Chip-Seq to look further into this.

5. In RNA-Seq one of the findings was the EGR1 is significantly downregulated in combination therapy as compared to targeted therapy. EGR1 is a transcription factor. Several of its targets are also downregulated. The seen that if EGR1 is knockedout then targeted therapy works while just EGR1 or combination therapy show no effect.

6. They have heatmaps which show that combination therapy works kinda in reverse with the targeted one i.e in RNA seq the highly up regulated genes in targeted therapy are down in combination therapy as compared to targeted and vice versa. Same this is seen if chip seq in terms of LFC of signal.

7. In terms of actual effect they propose that this combination affects BRD4. BRD4 is known to be localized at enhancers and promoters. It is dynamically regulated in response to factors as NF-kB pathway and in response to inhibition by MEK1/2.

## Glossary

1. **Tumor Suppression by Kinase Inhibitors**: Kinases are enzymes that can add a phosphate group to proteins as a post translational modification. In cancer abnormal activation of protein phosphorylation is frequently seen. A lot of kinases are thus targeted to control for cancer growth.[Source](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/76094)

2. **In Vivo**: In living

3. **In Vitro**: In test tube, in glass etc.

4. **Refractory**: resistant to a process or stimulus.
