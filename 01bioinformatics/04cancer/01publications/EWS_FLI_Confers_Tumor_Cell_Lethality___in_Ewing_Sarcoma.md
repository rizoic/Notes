1. **CDK12**: Cyclin Dependant Kinase 12. It will introduce a phosphate group to C terminal domain of a large subunit(Rbp1) of RNA polII. Basically the reaction that will happen in `ATP + a protien = ADP + a phosphorylated protien`. They are frequently disregulated in cancer and thus a target in many cancer chemotherapies.CDK's in general can be divided into two groups cell cycle associated CDKs(CDK 1,2,4,6) and transcription associated CDKs(CDK 7,8,9,11,12,13).

2. **PARP**:
