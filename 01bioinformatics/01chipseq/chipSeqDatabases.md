# DATABASES FOR CHIP SEQ DATA

Ok so if you want to find if chip data exists for a partuclar cell type/cell line these are some of the resources you can use to look for it:-

1. **GEO Search**

You can substitute the name of the cell line/cell type in [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds?term=sjsa1%5BAll%20Fields%5D%20AND%20%22Genome%20binding/occupancy%20profiling%20by%20high%20throughput%20sequen%22%5BFilter%5D&cmd=DetailsSearch) URL format and then search. This will filter the results for chip seq results only if any.

2. [**Cistrome Data Browser**](http://cistrome.org/db/#/)

This includes a data browser where you can filter by Species, Biological Sources and Factors. It applies a uniform analysis pipeline called ChiLin on all the samples.

3. You can also use the [ENA search](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/warehouse/search) to search for a dataset.

4. Some of the other data bases which could be of interest are [Chip-Atlas](https://chip-atlas.org), [ChipBase](http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/chipbase) and [Remap](http://pedagogix-tagc.univ-mrs.fr/remap/)
