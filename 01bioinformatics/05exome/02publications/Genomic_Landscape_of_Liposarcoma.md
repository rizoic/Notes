# Genomic Landscape of Liposarcoma

## Notes

1. Carboxypeptidase M(CPM) recurrently amplified gene is well-differentiated/de-differentiated LPS was notes as a putative oncodene involed in EGFR pathway.
2. Tumor suppressor role for Neurofibromin1(NF1) gene.
3. Microarrays used for Copy Number analysis. Exome Sequencing used for discovery of somatic mutations. Discovered somatic mutations and some prominent genes were then sequenced with targeted sequencing.
4. Pathway analysis done with Path-Scan to come up with  a list of significant pathways
