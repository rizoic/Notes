1. ribosomal RNA's comprise of 90% of all the RNA and these are usually depleted during RNA seq by doing something like a Poly A selection. However if these are not sufficinetly depleted then you may say a high rate of multi mapping. This is because a large amout of rRNA are repeats/paralogs of each other[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631051/)
