# Notes for the book R for Data Science

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Introduction
```{r}
# Working with the mpg data frame
mpg

# Look into the relationship between displ(engine size) and hwy(fuel efficiency)
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# So we can see as an when the engine size increases the fuel efficiency is in general going down.
# You can have a global mapping or you can have a per geom mapping

# Exercises
# Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
ggplot(data = mpg)
# Its just a blank canvas

# How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
# Number of rows
nrow(mpg)

# Number of cols
ncol(mpg)

# To see both together
dim(mpg)
```
