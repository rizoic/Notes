# AUTOJUMP

Autojump is a very handy utility to quickly jump between freuqently used directories. Once makes working in the command line highly productive. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/wting/autojump)

One thing to keep in mind though is that autojump creates a database of directories you cd to. It also keeps track of how many times you do it.
