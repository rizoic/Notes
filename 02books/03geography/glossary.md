## **squall**

The term "squall" is used to refer to a sudden wind-speed increase lasting minutes. 

There are different versions of the word's origins:

 - By one version, the word appears to be Nordic in origin, but its etymology is considered obscure. It probably has its roots in the word skvala an Old Norse word meaning literally, to *squeal*. 
 - By another version, it is an alteration of squeal influenced by *bawl*.

In 1962 the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defined that to be classified as a "squall", the wind must increase at least 8 m/s and must attain a top speed of at least 11 m/s, lasting at least one minute in duration. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall)
