# WCALC

Wcalc is a handy commandline calculator utility. I have found the included in most linux distributions not so user freindly but then maybe I do need to explore it more. You can get more info on Wcalc [here](http://w-calc.sourceforge.net/)

It comes in very handy for some basic quick calculations on the command line. You can alternatively use python/R shells to as calculators.

Some examles of wcalc in operation are below
```bash
wcalc 10+12
wcalc 10.4324/543543.543534
```
