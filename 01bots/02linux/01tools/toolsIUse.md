# TOOLS I USE

## Reference

### RSS

1. [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) - is a good command line tool to follow RSS feeds. Its simple and straightforward to use though you will not be able to use it on your mobile incase that is a requirement.

## System

### Ubuntu

1. **[Plank](https://github.com/ricotz/plank)** - Plank is a stupidly simple dock for ubuntu. It respects workspaces. In a workspace I want to see only icons for applications that are open in that workspace. In case you are unable to change the preferences remember you can press *Ctrl* and right click the dock to reveal the option for preferences. Another thing i liked about it is that it is being actively maintained.

## Text Editing

### Markdown

1. **[Typora](https://typora.io/)** - This is a simple markdown editor with support for WYSIWYG. You can customize it with themes. It can automatically handle pasted images for you. 

## Command Line

1. [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) - Autojump is a very handy utility to quickly jump between freuqently used directories. Once makes working in the command line highly productive. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/wting/autojump)

   One thing to keep in mind though is that autojump creates a database of directories you cd to. It also keeps track of how many times you do it.

2. [wcalc](http://w-calc.sourceforge.net/) - Wcalc is a handy commandline calculator utility. I have found the included in most linux distributions not so user freindly but then maybe I do need to explore it more. You can get more info on Wcalc [here](http://w-calc.sourceforge.net/)

   It comes in very handy for some basic quick calculations on the command line. You can alternatively use python/R shells to as calculators.

   Some examles of wcalc in operation are below
   ```bash
   wcalc 10+12
   wcalc 10.4324/543543.543534
   ```

3.  [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - Bat is a handy replacement for cat with wings as the author says. It has syntax highligting, line numbers, git integration

## Browser Addons

### Firefox

1. [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/) - This is a must have addon for a power-user. The capabilities it has are mind-boggling. It is one addon that can truly end up saving a lot of time for you.
