# Blue Print Consortium RNA Seq analysis

1. The following analysis were done for the BluePrint Consortium RNA seq data
   - Expression Analysis
   - RNA Editing Analysis(A>G and C>T) in the 3â€™ region
   - Alternative splicing analysis
     - Isoform usage
     - Intron Retention
   - Alternative polyadenylation
2. To validate if the analysis was correct expression levels for cell specific TFS and surface markers was checked.
3. The analysis did PCA based on splcing, expression and editing. Splicing seems to seperate the hemetopoetic lineage well.
4. Like epigenomics RNA has its own world we usually tend to focus on just differential expression but there are so many things that vary in the RNA world and which can have an impact.
5. Development of an expression parsing bot to pick up known keywords and create an analysis pipeline on the fly.
6. #TODO - Look into rna editing, differential polyadenylation, circRNA analysis, lncRNA analysis.
