## CircRNA epigenetics

Ok so here is the TLDR:- circRNAs can cause looping of two distant regions in the genome and thus have an interaction happening between them. 

1. CircRNAs are formed be back splicing of exons. It is something to do with lariat formation during splicing. Only continous exons are included in this process.
2. How can two distant regions for circRNAs. It should be formed during splicing right? :thinking:
3. But their theory is that by chip-PET you come to know of two distant regions interacting with each other. Then you correlate this info with the circRNAs that are seen in the individual. Find such cricRNAs that has components of both the interacting partners for Chip-PET and hen say that this interaction is happening due to the circRNA. This can be validated by deleting the circRNA and showing that this interaction does not happen then.
4. The theory is that circRNA will have complementary components to both the partners and thus it will bring them together and facilitate the interaction.
5. Also if you are looking into this look only at nuclear circRNAs as only they can facilitate chromatic interactions.
