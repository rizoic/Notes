# Gencode

## Questions

1. What is this basic set of transcripts from gencode?

   The transcripts tagged as "basic" form part of a subset of representative transcripts for each gene. This subset **prioritises full-length protein coding transcripts over partial or non-protein coding transcripts** within the same gene, and intends to highlight those transcripts that will be useful to the majority of users.
