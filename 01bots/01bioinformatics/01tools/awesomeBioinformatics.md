My collection of useful tools/notes/repos related to bioinformatics

## tools

### visualization

#### [intervene](https://intervene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)

[intervene](https://intervene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) seems like an interesting project for creating quick Venn diagrams and upset plots from bed files

### [blat](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat)

blat is an awesome tool which should be your first choice if you need to scan a seqeunce against a reference genome fasta file. It is a very good choice if you just have a couple of sequences to search. On that not if you want it to be real quick and dont want to do it programmatically you can even do it in IGV with its `BLAT` option.
