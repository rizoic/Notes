# IGV

1. You can quickly search for a sequence against a ref genome using the `BLAT` option in IGV.
2. You have to keep in mind that IGV is by default 0 based. It will always consider your start coordinates are 0 based and show you things at one position higher. Its better to stick to 0 based things for stuff.
