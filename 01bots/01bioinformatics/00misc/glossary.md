# Glossary

- **Spike In**

Used primarily in RNA differential expression quantification using RNA-Seq/Microarray. It involved adding a known transcript in known concentrations so that the analysis can be standardised/tested.

- **CGI-TCGA-TARGET  FET Score**

a score derived from a statistical test— **Fisher’s Exact Test (FET)** — that states the likelihood that the variant is somatic given the observed read counts in the tumor and normal samples. The score is transformed from the fractional-value result of the test to a Phred-scaled integer. This score is present only for variants with the “SS=Somatic” tag, and is named “CGA_SOMFE.” 
In the  case of a somatic call, a lower-value  indicates that the DNB counts are less likely  to be random  or more likely to represent a somatic variant. Alternatively, a higher-value  would correspond  to a germline  variant or maybe a false positive call in the tumor, where the DNB counts  supporting reference and variant seem to be randomly assigned to the tumor or normal
