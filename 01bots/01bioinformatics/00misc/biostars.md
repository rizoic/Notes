## [Hosting BAM files](https://www.biostars.org/p/335986/)

[Cyverse](https://www.cyverse.org) can be used to store bam files which can then be served to UCSC. Handy just in case you dont have a server where you can upload you bam/bw files

## [Mining Pubmed Objects](https://www.biostars.org/p/336003/)
