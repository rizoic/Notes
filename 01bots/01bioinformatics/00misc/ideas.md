# Ideas

1. There is a need for an histone cheatsheet. Some of them exist but more are required

2. Teaser is a really handy tool and should be used more frequently

3. A need for a command line venn diagram tool which has modes like a bed mode and a list mode and with a few adjustments it can output a quick venn diagrams with sensible default and if required can be made into a scaled mode.
