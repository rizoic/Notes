# Observations

1. Single ends usually have lower mapping rates because we don't have the other pair to help in the alignment
2. The Ensemble genome browser is very powerful. It can also add in a lot of tracks. As a handy utility it also links to UCSC genome browser.
3. One needs to know the UCSC table browser properly. I find biomart R package and the UCSC table browser very important utilities for any bioinformatican. #TODO. To start with this is the [User Guide](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTablesHelp.html). These is also a [MySQL interface](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/mysql.html) which is also very handy.
4. There is so much happening and so much todo in bioinformatics. Two areas i.e. transcriptomics and epigenomics itself seem so awesome and have so much happening in them. To add this there are areas of variation, proteomics and metagenomics. And plus so much of free data available.
