## Notes

1. Ribosome profiling, the recently developed high throughput sequencing technique, enabledthe mapping of translated regions genome-wide.
2. This technique takes advantage of the fact that ribosomes actively engaged in translation can protect their associated mRNA fragments against RNAse digestion. 
3. The basic idea of ribosome profiling is to perform deep-sequencing of the ribosome-protected mRNA fragment (~30 nts), termed ribosome footprints, to determine the occupancy of translating ribosomes on a given mRNA.
